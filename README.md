# Employee Directory

## Description
Application that allows for organization of employees. Primarily has search and filter functionality to sort through large amounts of data (employees)

## Technologies
The application is uses react.js and JSX with semantic ui react as the design framework. The employees are generated using axios and the random user api.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was getting the sorting and filtering to work. Using the semantic ui elements were a little tricky and some didn't work for reasons not mentioned in their documnetation. I also ran into infinite state rerenders a few too many times.
